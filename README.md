# React + Vite
My-Todo 
A simple react+ vite based todo list website for managing daily tasks.
I have also used Tailwindcss for this project.



List the main features of my app are:

1.Add, edit, and delete tasks

2.Mark tasks as completed

3.Persist tasks in localStorage

4.Responsive design




Prerequisites: Node.js, npm/yarn, etc.

Steps:

1.Clone the repository

2.Install dependencies (npm install)

3.Run the app (npm start)


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
